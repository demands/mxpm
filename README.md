# mxpm

Quickly toggle the active paths in your project using the fuzzy finder.

### a quick disclaimer

mxpm is my very first atom package, and I'm currently still figuring out how it all works. As such, don't expect much.
On the other hand, I'm pretty attached to this flow (quickly adding and removing projects from my sidebar seems extremely useful!) so odds are that I will continue maintaining this package unless someone else writes something better.
